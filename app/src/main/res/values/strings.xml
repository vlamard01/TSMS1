    <string name="home_text">The Turtle Sense Monitoring System (TSMS) is an all-inclusive sensing unit designed to monitor critical attributes of sea turtle nests. The unitâ€™s design will aid research scientists in their conservation efforts and help thwart the threat of extinction facing the seven extant species of sea turtles around the world. Turtle Sense UCF has focused on creating a nest monitoring system that provides research scientists real time information on the health and condition of sea turtle eggs throughout their incubation  period. The main focus of the system are : thermal  sensing, motion sensing, moisture/humidity detection, development of a web API and mobile application, Wi-Fi broadcasting capabilities.</string>
